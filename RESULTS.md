## 1. Headline scoreboard (VSI-Bench, mean of types)

| # | condition | score | 95% CI | Δ vs frames16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | current frame only | 0.266 | [0.252, 0.280] | −4.5 pts |
| 2 | frames16 (16 video frames) | 0.311 | [0.297, 0.325] | — |
| 3 | frames12 | 0.316 | [0.303, 0.329] | +0.5 (n.s.) |
| 4 | renders_only (5 rendered views) | 0.301 | [0.287, 0.316] | −1.0 (n.s.) |
| 5 | memory (12 frames + 5 renders) | 0.333 | [0.320, 0.347] | **+2.2 [+0.9, +3.6]** |
| 6 | memory32 (better renderer recipe) | 0.331 | [0.315, 0.346] | +2.0 (≈ #5) |
| 7 | tree (training-free branch/prune/fuse) | 0.331 | [0.317, 0.345] | **+2.0 [+0.6, +3.3]** |
| 8 | sft_frames16 (Stage I adapter) | 0.326 | [0.311, 0.341] | **+1.5 [+0.4, +2.7]** |
| 9 | **sft_memory (Stage I adapter + renders)** | **0.336** | [0.323, 0.349] | **+2.5 [+1.1, +4.0]** |

## 2. Design-doc hypothesis checks

| check | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| RQ1 / go-no-go #1: explicit-memory views beat frame prompting | **PASS** | memory − frames16 = +2.2 [+0.9, +3.6]; gain is render-driven (frames12 ≈ frames16), concentrated on layout questions (counting +9.5, room size +3.4, rel-direction up) |
| Renderer viability (biggest unvalidated assumption) | **VIABLE** | coverage 65→82→87% at 16/32/48 source frames (fixed held-out poses); covered-pixel PSNR stable ~16–17 dB → holes, not wrong colors; residual ~15% is never-observed geometry. Recipe: 32 frames + splat 2 |
| "Can higher video sampling rate fix rendering?" | **Largely yes** | see above; diminishing returns after 32 frames; validity guard still required |
| Render coverage → QA accuracy? | **NO (negative result)** | memory32 (0.331) ≈ memory (0.333): VLM, not renderer, is the bottleneck; 16-frame recipe kept for QA |
| H3 premise: frames & renders complementary | **SUPPORTED** | renders_only ≈ frames16 overall but +12.6 on hard rel-direction, +7.9 abs-distance; combined beats both |
| H3: untrained fusion is harmful | **CONFIRMED** | tree fused-mode accuracy 0.268 vs 0.315–0.364 for other paths |
| H4: token confidence is a poor branch score | **CONFIRMED** | trained head AUROC 0.907 vs 0.751 token-logprob; state-selection 0.568 vs 0.530 (oracle 0.820) |
| Teacher audit (§6.8) | **RISK FOUND** | 32B teacher *degrades* with more views on MindCube (0.412→0.371); mitigated: control labels from outcome patterns only, answers from GT |
| Teacher stronger than student (distillation headroom) | **YES (video domain)** | 32B frames16 0.386 vs 7B 0.311 |

## 3. Stage I — SFT controller (LoRA on 7B, 16.8k examples)

MindCube tinybench evidence ladder, paired pre/post:

| state | pre-SFT | post-SFT | paired Δ (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 view | 0.343 | 0.533 | +0.190 [+0.152, +0.228] |
| all views | 0.255 | 0.508 | **+0.253 [+0.197, +0.306]** |
| all + render | 0.260 | 0.494 | +0.234 [+0.183, +0.285] |

- More-views degradation nearly eliminated (−8.8 pts pre → −2.5 post):
  **cross-view integration learned.**
- Control policy de-degenerated: base = 100% STOP everywhere; SFT = 24–43% MOVE
  at partial evidence, 98% STOP at full evidence. RENDER never emitted (2.5%
  training share — to rebalance).
- **Cross-domain transfer positive** (scoreboard rows 8–9): +1.5 pts on
  VSI-Bench frames16; sft_memory best overall (0.336); hard perspective
  questions 0.330 vs 0.247. Cost: appearance-order −5 pts (no temporal
  questions in MindCube — mix a temporal slice next round).

## 4. Stage II — confidence head

45,743 on-policy states (SFT policy), 3584-d features, label = eventual
correctness, group-level 80/10/10 split, temperature-calibrated (T=0.95):

| metric (held-out groups) | trained head | token-logprob |
|---|---|---|
| AUROC | **0.907** | 0.751 |
| Brier | 0.117 | — |
| ECE | 0.019 | — |
| state-selection accuracy | **0.568** | 0.530 |

Oracle selection 0.820; fixed last-state 0.523. On-policy ladders flat across
depth (~0.51) → labels not depth-confounded.

## 5. End-to-end systems

| system | score | notes |
|---|---|---|
| ViewTree-lite (training-free) | 0.331 | matches static memory; fixes size regression (0.347) via fallback, loses counting gain (0.255) via premature consensus; ~3.3 s/question (~2.5× static) |
| **Trained tree (SFT adapter + calibrated head)** | *running, ETA ~15:30* | head drives branch scoring, consensus, pruning, fuse/direct selection |

## 6. Renderer study (held-out novel views, fixed eval poses, 30 scenes)

| source frames | splat | coverage | covered-pixel PSNR | overall PSNR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 1 | 0.654 | 16.1 dB | 10.0 dB |
| 16 | 2 | 0.678 | 15.9 dB | 10.2 dB |
| 32 | 1 | 0.816 | 16.6 dB | 12.0 dB |
| 32 | 2 | 0.833 | 16.4 dB | 12.2 dB |
| 48 | 1 | 0.869 | 16.5 dB | 12.7 dB |

## 7. Next milestones

1. Trained-tree VSI-Bench result (running) → §5.
2. Stage III fusion training (complementary/redundant/distractor sets from
   ladders) — targets the fused-mode weakness.
3. Control-data rebalance (RENDER share, temporal slice) → SFT v2.
4. Stage IV resource-constrained GRPO (doc §6.6) — after III.
